# chicago-scooter-api-audit
A technical deep-dive into Chicago's live e-scooter telemetry to master API data extraction and normalization. By querying the Chicago Data Portal, this project uncovers operational "ghost trips," maintenance failure rates, and urban density's impact on transit speed. It demonstrates server-side aggregation and advanced Pandas data modeling.
